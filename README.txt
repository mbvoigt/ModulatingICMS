Intracortical microstimulation naturally modulates induced responses

 The present script, inlcuding all accompanying sub-scripts, was used to
 analyze the data and prepare the figures for the manuscript entitled
 "Intracortical microstimulation naturally modulates induced responses"
 by Mathias B. Voigt, Prasandhya A. Yusuf and Andrej Kral.

 Main file: ModulatingICMS_main.m

 Processing is arranged to mostly follow the occurence of the figures in 
 the manuscript. This is neither the order in which the script was run 
 from top to bottom, nor how it was written chronologically.

Abbreviations:
   AEES - All Electrodes Electrically Stimulated
   CBPT - Cluster-based permutation test
   TEI - Tone-Electric Interference
   LFP - Local field potential
